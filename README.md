# TodoListApp
todo app made for practice using java swing to create simple applications

Finished todo app will have ability to add Todo items, check them off, edit items, add sub-tasks, delete items, save and load todo-lists, and create new lists.

in the future, I plan to revisit this project and add further features. Such as style editing, drag-and-drop reordering,
and due dates, complete with highlighting upcoming, due, and past due tasks.

other features I'd like to include would be task grouping, allowing you to partition off tasks belonging to a certain group
