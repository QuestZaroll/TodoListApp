# TodoListApp
todo app made for practice using java swing to create simple applications

Finished todo app will have ability to add Todo items, check them off, edit items, add sub-tasks, delete items, save and load todo-lists, and create new lists.

in the future, I plan to revisit this project and add further features. Such as style editing, drag-and-drop reordering, and due dates, complete with highlighting upcoming, due, and past due tasks.

other features I'd like to include would be task grouping, allowing you to partition off tasks belonging to a certain group

I'm still a beginner in all of this, so the program certainly has many design concerns and a fair amount of bugs that I haven't yet found. additionally, this isn't yet finished! I still have a few more features to add, but at a very barebones level it is currently functional. I've included a .jar of the project here, I'm working on changing this but currently in order for it to automatically find a folder named "TodoList", and search for a folder named "Lists", the folder TodoList and TodoList.jar must be in the same folder level. as in, say there's a folder "Todo App", inside that is the folder "TodoList", and the app TodoList, and inside the "TodoList" folder is the folder "List", with the file "FinishingTouches.txt" as that is currently what I have it to load on default. 

I will note, I have tried to download the .jar on another laptop and I kept getting a Java Exception Has Occured error message. So good luck, I couldn't figure out why :(

Soon, I will add in proper configuration preferences management and allow the user, *you!* to set where they'd like the default folder to be, among other preferences.
