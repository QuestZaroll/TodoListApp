# TodoListApp
todo app made for practice using java swing to create simple applications

Finished todo app will have ability to add Todo items, check them off, edit items, add sub-tasks, delete items, save and load todo-lists, and create new lists.

in the future, I plan to revisit this project and add further features. Such as style editing, drag-and-drop reordering,
and due dates, complete with highlighting upcoming, due, and past due tasks.
